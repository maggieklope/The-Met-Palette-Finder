# The-Met-Palette-Finder

Using the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access Initiative(https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), this Shiny App will allow you to explore the Met Collection, and even use jpegs of paintings to create a color palette to inspire your own work.

Requires a copy of the MetObjects.csv (see: https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).  

Currently, Met Website does not allow for easy scraping of open access images, so making a color palette directly from the collection is not working.  More updates to follow.
